1. raw:
As data from 2016 Jul-Dec of yellow cab have no more lon-lat info any more, we used 2015 Jul-Dec yellow cab data. So 2015 Jul - 2016 Jun is one whole year. We can do seasonal comparison as well.

Format of each row of each file: ((Line, DayofWeek, Hour, Day, Month) ,count)

2. csv:
use transform.ipynb to clean raw output into csv file
